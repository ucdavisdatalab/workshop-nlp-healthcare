# Working with Text Data in R

## Setup

### Packages

In R, and most programming languages, there are many packages - code written by other people to help with certain tasks. 
For this workshop we will be using two packages - 'tm' and 'ggplot2'.
The 'tm' - text mining - package has methods for mining text with R including importing data, storing corpora, applying operations on corpora (such as common preprocessing methods), and document term matrices.
The 'ggplot2' package has functions related to plotting and visualizing data.


Run this command if you don't already have these packages installed.

```r
install.packages('tm')
install.packages('ggplot2')
install.packages('Matrix')
install.packages('readr')
```

Once the packages are installed, load them into your R environment.

```r
library('tm')
library('ggplot2')
library('Matrix')
library('readr')
```

You can find the documentation for the package [online](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/tm.pdf)\
Within R/RStudio you can browse function documentation with the following syntax.
```
?TermDocumentMatrix
```

###  Data for this workshop

For this workshop, we are looking at a set of abstracts of medical journal articles related to breast cancer.
We have 714 abstracts, stored in a csv, with duplicates. 
We would like to get the key words from each abstract, as well as visualize / check for groupings of abstracts in two dimensions.\



```r
data <- read_csv(url("https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop-nlp-healthcare/abstracts.csv"))
```

```
We have a dataframe with 714 rows, each row referring to a different abstract. 
For each abstract we have the authors, year published, title of the paper, name of the journal, and the full text.

Let's look at the text from the first abstract

```r
data$text[[1]]
```

```
## [1] "Background: The international standard radiotherapy schedule for early breast cancer delivers 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2·0 Gy over 5 weeks, but there is a long history of non-standard regimens delivering a lower total dose using fewer, larger fractions (hypofractionation). We aimed to test the benefits of radiotherapy schedules using fraction sizes larger than 2·0 Gy in terms of local-regional tumour control, normal tissue responses, quality of life, and economic consequences in women prescribed post-operative radiotherapy. Methods: Between 1999 and 2001, 2215 women with early breast cancer (pT1-3a pN0-1 M0) at 23 centres in the UK were randomly assigned after primary surgery to receive 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2·0 Gy over 5 weeks or 40 Gy in 15 fractions of 2·67 Gy over 3 weeks. Women were eligible for the trial if they were aged over 18 years, did not have an immediate reconstruction, and were available for follow-up. Randomisation method was computer generated and was not blinded. The protocol-specified principal endpoints were local-regional tumour relapse, defined as reappearance of cancer at irradiated sites, late normal tissue effects, and quality of life. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN59368779. Findings: 1105 women were assigned to the 50 Gy group and 1110 to the 40 Gy group. After a median follow up of 6·0 years (IQR 5·0-6·2) the rate of local-regional tumour relapse at 5 years was 2·2% (95% CI 1·3-3·1) in the 40 Gy group and 3·3% (95% CI 2·2 to 4·5) in the 50 Gy group, representing an absolute difference of -0·7% (95% CI -1·7% to 0·9%)-ie, the absolute difference in local-regional relapse could be up to 1·7% better and at most 1% worse after 40 Gy than after 50 Gy. Photographic and patient self-assessments indicated lower rates of late adverse effects after 40 Gy than after 50 Gy. Interpretation: A radiation schedule delivering 40 Gy in 15 fractions seems to offer rates of local-regional tumour relapse and late adverse effects at least as favourable as the standard schedule of 50 Gy in 25 fractions."

Notice that within the text there are a variety of potential issues. 
For example, some words are capitalized, there is punctuation, weird symbols, and numbers. 
For many NLP methods, we want to normalize the texts to get around these issues. 
The 'tm' package has several built in features for normalizing text. 
The first step is to load the text into a 'corpus' object.

## [2] EBCTCG (Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group). Effect of radiotherapy after mastectomy and axillary surgery on 10-year recurrence and 20-year breast cancer mortality: meta-analysis of individual patient data for 8135 women in 22 randomised trials. Lancet 2014; 383: 2127–35—During revision of the appendix of this Article after peer review, some analyses of local recurrence were omitted. These have now been restored in the updated appendix. All analyses (and page numbers) in the previous version of the appendix remain unchanged, as do the medical findings of the paper. The correction has been made to the appendix as of Nov 21, 2014.

Use the tm_map function to apply a transformation on each element of the corpus object.  
Alternatively use the tm_parLapply function to do the same in parallel.

```r
mycorpus <- tm_map(mycorpus, tolower)
mycorpus <- tm_map(mycorpus, removePunctuation, ucp=TRUE)
mycorpus <- tm_map(mycorpus, removeNumbers)
mycorpus <- tm_map(mycorpus, removeWords, stopwords("en")) 
```

Now that we have normalized the text, lets look at the first abstract again.

```r
mycorpus[[1]]$content
```

```

```

It looks 'normalized' but how do we model this? how do we apply NLP algorithms on it?

## The Bag of Words Representation

Consider: \
what is a text document to a computer?  \
What can it do with a sequence of characters? \  

In order for us to apply statistical methods on a document, we need a representation of texts that is easy for a computer to process, but still encodes information related to that text's content.
One such representation is the Bag of Words format.\

Bag of Words is a way of representing a document that encodes a document as a 'bag' of its tokens.
The document is represented as the words that appeared in the document and the number of times those words appeared.
All information about word order is lost in this representation, however, for many NLP methods, this is still an effective representation of the content of the document.\

![bag of words image](./img/bow.png)

The power of the bag of words representation is that each document can be represented in the same vector space.
We do so by defining the vector dimensions to reflect the vocabulary across all the documents.
The vectors can then be merged into a matrix called a Document Term Matrix.

![dtm image](./img/dtm.png)


## The Document Term Matrix

In brief, a Document Term Matrix:  
  - each document is represented by a set of tokens and their counts  
  - the order of tokens is not encoded in this representation  
  - the basis of many text processing methods, including document classification and topic modeling  

In R we can use a DocumentTermMatrix function from the 'tm' package to create this structure from our corpus.  

### Creating a Document Term Matrix from the corpus object    
From the 'corpus' object we can create a document term matrix.

```r
mydtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(mycorpus)
```
Note: the DocumentTermMatrix automatically sets all the characters to lower case.

### Exploring with a DTM  

A useful tool is the inspect function from the 'tm' package.

```r
inspect(mydtm)
```

```

From this format it we can find word counts and document lengths.

```r
document_lengths <- rowSums(as.matrix(mydtm))
word_counts <- colSums(as.matrix(mydtm))
```

We can get a sorted list of the biggest documents.

```r
sorted_document_lengths <- sort(document_lengths, decreasing=TRUE)
barplot(sorted_document_lengths[1:10], col = "tan", las = 2)
```

Or a sorted list of words and their frequencies.

```r
sorted_word_counts <- sort(word_counts, decreasing=TRUE)
barplot(sorted_word_counts[1:10], col = "tan", las = 2)
```

## TF-IDF

TF-IDF stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency. 
It is a VERY popular method for finding documents relevant to a users search term. 
It can also be used as an effective (often times better than simple bag of words) representation of documents for statistical modeling of documents in a corpus. 

### Intuition behind TF-IDF

TF-IDF combines two attributes that may signal a words importance in a document into a single metric. 
The first is the 'term frequency (TF)' - how often the word appeared within that document. 
It makes intuitive sense that if a word appears many times in a document, that the document is about something related to that term.
The second attribute is the 'inverse document frequency (IDF)' - a measure of what proportion of the documents the word appeared in. If a word appears in all documents, its weight should be reduced. 
Conversely, if a word appears only in few documents, it should be highly weighted for those documents. 

### TF-IDF formula

```
tfidf(t,d,D) = tf(t,d) * idf(t,D)
```
Where, tf(t,d) is a function of a terms(t) frequency for a given document(d). 
And, idf(t,D) is the inverse function of a terms(t) appearance across all the documents(D).  There are many variations of functions for tf(t,d) and idf(t,D) that can be used for computing TF-IDF.  


### TF-IDF from DTM
Create tf-idf weighted DTM in R

```r
tfidf_dtm <- weightTfIdf(mydtm, normalize=TRUE) 
```

Inspect the new dtm

```r
inspect(tfidf_dtm)
```

Compare the tfidf representation with the tf representation for a single abstract

```r
tf_doc10 <- as.matrix(mydtm[10,])
tf <- colSums(tf_doc10)
tfidf_doc10 <- as.matrix(tfidf_dtm[10,])
tfidf <- colSums(tfidf_doc10)
barplot(sort(tf, decreasing=TRUE)[1:10], col = "tan", las = 2)
